#### Compose:
##### I am using Jetpack Compose for building UI, as it is very helpful for large screens and handles all different screen sizes, orientations, and form factors - adaptive layout changes based on the screen space available to it.


##### Lightweight Thread:
###### I am using coroutine as a concurrency design pattern that you simplify code that executes asynchronously, helpful in more than one field as memory leaks and background tasks executing.
